### Hi there 👋
# My name is Jason, I'm a full stack developer. I received an Associates Degree in computer programming back in 2019. 👨‍🎓 I've learned the basics of Python, Java, C++, Visual Basic, Xamarin, and COBOL. I'm most experienced with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm currently mostly focused on Front-end work. I also dabble a little in game development. 🎮 I'm always in search of projects to help me learn new concepts, gain experience and build up my portfolio!⚡
